Although these demos show that these models work independently, it is possible to combine them for achieving certain goal. 
For example, NER can be used to remove confidential information prior to sending the text to the AI model for further processing.
In addition, further work can be done to leverage these models for real time threat or emergent trend monitoring using unsupervise learning to identify themes.
The possibilities are endless.[The following is AI generated content] AI is a powerful tool that, when combined with machine learning, can perform 
exceptionally well for a wide range of tasks, ultimately enhancing human capabilities and driving progress. By automating routine tasks, AI allows 
humans to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work, leading to increased productivity and innovation. The collaboration between human 
intelligence and AI's computational power opens up new horizons for solving complex problems and generating innovative ideas.
These advancements spark curiosity and open up new possibilities for various sectors, including police agencies, healthcare, finance, and more. 
For police agencies, in particular, the integration of AI and ML can revolutionize investigative processes, enhance threat detection, and improve 
overall efficiency. By embracing these technologies, police agencies can better manage administrative tasks, identify patterns in criminal activities, 
and respond more effectively to emerging threats.**""")
